**BlueBrick!**  
(Think *Blueprint* + *LEGO Brick*)  

**Inspiration:**  
Inspired in part by the LEGO Brickit app ([brickit.app](https://brickit.app)), which identifies creative builds from your LEGO bricks, **BlueBrick!** brings the same idea to the world of electronics.  

**What does BlueBrick! do?**  
BlueBrick! breaks down electronic devices—like smartphones, laptops, and other gadgets—into their individual components, offering insights into what they are and how they can be used.  

**Why BlueBrick!?**  
1. **Learn & Explore**  
   - Make learning about electronics approachable, interactive, and fun.  
   - See how everyday devices work, component by component.  

2. **Recycle & Reuse**

   - Empower users to minimize e-waste through upcycling.

3. **Promote Sustainability**
